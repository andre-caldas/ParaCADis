/** Stores and manages the placement of a coordinate system.
 *
 * Vectors need to be interpreted in some context.
 * We can think there is an "abstract" global coordinate system.
 * By "abstract", we mean it is not managed by @class CoordinateSystem.
 * To place a coordinate system `C` inside some other coordinate system `G`,
 * we need to specify how points in `C` are converted to points in `G`.
 * This is what @class CoordinateSyste does.
 *
 * In practice, the user, however, does not care about "how to convert".
 * For the user, this is basically a @class Container.
 * The user wants to put things inside this coordinate and have them
 * to appear on the right place. Also, the user wants methods
 * to place and manipulate the whole "container" in such a way that
 * everything inside moves along.
