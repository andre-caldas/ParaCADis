/**
 * This class holds a constant and thread-safe object that is ALWAYS AVAILABLE.

 * atomic shared pointer to a constant data structure.
 * This way, threads that still rely on old data do not crash.
 * And no one needs to wait for the data to be generated,
 * because new data is generated "off line" and it is just
 * swapped with the official when it ready for use.
