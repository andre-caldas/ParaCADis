  Resolving consists of querying objects according to a path.
  When the final object is found, a ResultHolder is returned.
  While the ResultHolder is held, the object is guaranteed to exist
  although its path might have changed in the meanwhile.

  However, having a ResultHolder is not enough to access the data.
  ParaCADis is highly multithreaded and accessing data that
  is shared among threads requires holding a "gate".

  =======

  1. Ensures the object does not get destructed while the ResultHolder
     is held.
  2. Can be used to acquire a ReaderGate or a WriterGate that can be
     used to access the object data.

  2. This gate causes any process that requests write access
     to the referenced object to block.
