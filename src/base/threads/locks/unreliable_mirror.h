   * and commited (written to original), but those are
   * non-blocking operations and may fail.
   *
   * This class was created to deal with ImGUI.

   * Destructor **must** block until update and commit are successful.

   * @attention
   * Different from other gates, descendants of `UnreliableMirrorBase`
   * are supposed to live long. Therefore, those descendants must
   * warrant (by hoding a shared pointer) that the mirrored resource
   * remains valid while the mirror exists.
