   * The lock policy uses a @class MutexData to represent one mutex.
   *
   * The lock policy organizes locks in a hierarchy.
   * In a simple setting, shared locks can be locked
   * as long as the thread does not already hold any exclusive lock.
   * This ensures that shared lock will never dead lock as long as
   * we arrange the exclusive locks to never deadlock.
   * The simplest policy on exclusive locks is to never allow an exclusive
   * lock whanever our thread already holds a lock. In this simple setting,
   * all needed exclusive locks need to be locked at the same time.
   * The policy does not allow you to acquire any lock, exclusive or shared,
   * after acquiring an exclusive lock.
   *
   * However, in order to allow a little more flexibility,
   * the locks can be arranged in a hierarchy. So, the above simple policy
   * is implemented per hierarchy layer. The MutexData class implements
   * this hierarchy by keeping a #layer number.
